# CAFSolutionFactories
The Azure Cloud Adoption Framework is a methodology to guide Microsoft customers and partners during their journey to the cloud. One of the key things that we heard was a need for the cloud adoption guidance for specific workloads(SQL, WVD, AKS, Server Migration, SAP). To address this need, we have created eBook and DevOps project templates that are specific to the workloads in accordance to the Cloud Adoption Framework methodology. 

The solution factory material guides customers and partners according to Cloud Adoption Framework for an end to end implementation of specific workload. For details of how to do specific task, we reference our exiting docs. 

Content: 
We have technical and sales content. 

Technical Content
eBook: 
The eBook in the solution factory describes the activities that are needed across the spectrum of strategizing, planning, readiness, adoption, governing and managing for each workload. 

Azure DevOps Task List Project: 
If you are undertaking the project of implementing a workload, there will be multiple activities that will be needed to be performed. 
The Azure DevOps task list project has that features, user stories and tasks that are needed to perform for an end to end adoption.

Excel Task List:
We understand that everyone may not be using Azure DevOps, so we have supplied the list of task that needs to be performed for implementation of the workloads in excel format.
 
Supporting Documentation:     
We have included additional documentation that can help in the journey


Sales Content:
We have included PowerPoint decks for Cloud Adoption Framework and also for the specific workloads that can help to articulate the specific topic to a larger audience.
